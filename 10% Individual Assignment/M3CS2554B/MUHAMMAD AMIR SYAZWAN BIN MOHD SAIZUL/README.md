# 📝 Using Siege to Load Test httpbin.org
## 💡 INTRODUCTION

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Testing websites performance helps to determine how a system or web application services behaves under different levels of user load to identify bottlenecks to ensure website remain stable. This project conducts a load testing on [httpbin](https://httpbin.org/), a public HTTP request and respone website to observe how. I will be using [Siege](https://github.com/JoeDog/siege), an open-source test and benchmarking utility that runs on Linux to conduct the test. The main purpose of this test is to simulate real life traffic and analyze the collected data from the test such as slowdowns from large numbers of concurrent users.
