**Class:** M3CS2554B

## 1. Introduction

In today’s digital era, **web application performance** directly impacts user satisfaction and reliability. Applications that respond slowly or crash under heavy usage can cause poor user experience and reduced credibility.  
To ensure scalability and stability, **performance testing** is an essential step in any web system’s quality assurance process.

This project aims to conduct a **comprehensive performance test** on the **OpenWeatherMap API** (`https://openweathermap.org/api`) using **Locust**, an open-source load testing tool. The testing focuses on four critical areas:
- **Load Test**
- **Stress Test**
- **Soak Test**
- **Spike Test**

The main goal is to measure the API’s performance, discover potential bottlenecks, and propose optimizations for improved reliability.

## 2. Tool Selection: Locust

### 2.1 Overview

**Locust** is a Python-based load testing tool that allows users to simulate concurrent web traffic using code-defined user behaviors. It’s lightweight, scalable, and easy to integrate into CI/CD workflows.

### 2.2 Why Locust?

Locust was chosen for several reasons:

| Criteria | Locust Advantage |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Flexibility** | Uses Python to define realistic user actions. |
| **Scalability** | Distributes load across multiple machines. |
| **Real-Time Metrics** | Offers live stats on RPS, failures, and response times. |
| **API Compatibility** | Works seamlessly with REST APIs like OpenWeatherMap. |

Locust’s simplicity and extensibility make it ideal for this academic and professional evaluation.

---

## 3. Hypothesis

> *“The OpenWeatherMap API is expected to maintain stable performance under moderate load but may show latency increases or errors when subjected to extreme or sudden traffic due to API rate limiting and shared resource constraints.”*

This hypothesis will be tested under various simulated traffic conditions.

<img width="927" height="712" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80816778-971b-4831-b354-dfd611d86ae4" />

## 📌 Key Observations

### ✅ Request Volume & Endpoint Activity
- Over **28,000 requests** were successfully sent across two active endpoints.
- `/weather_by_city` received **zero traffic**, indicating it was either excluded from the test or misconfigured.

### ⚠️ Failure Rates & Error Types
- `/current_weather` had a **4.1% failure rate**, with **605 occurrences** of `[WinError 10054]` (connection forcibly closed).
- `/weather_by_coords` showed a **0.7% failure rate**, primarily due to **ConnectTimeoutError** and a few generic `HTTP 0` errors.
- These errors suggest backend instability and potential network timeout issues under load.

### 🐢 Latency & Response Time Distribution
- Both active endpoints had **high average response times** (~1230 ms), with **median values** around 1263–1264 ms.
- Extreme latency outliers were observed:
  - `/current_weather`: **Max 16.5 seconds**
  - `/weather_by_coords`: **Max 8.5 seconds**
- 99th percentile latencies exceeded **1.7 seconds**, indicating performance degradation at scale.

### 📉 Throughput & Consistency
- Request throughput was consistent at **2.0 RPS** per endpoint.
- Response time percentiles (50%–95%) were tightly grouped, suggesting predictable mid-range performance despite tail latency spikes.

### ⏳ Soak Test

<img width="1108" height="762" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee74e044-978f-4124-9dd2-5759e12e78bf" />

## 📌 Key Observations

### ✅ Request Volume & Endpoint Activity
- A total of **65,488 requests** were distributed across three endpoints.
- `/current_weather` received the highest traffic (**27,667 requests**), followed by `/weather_by_coords` and `/weather_forecast` (≈18,600 each).
- All endpoints maintained a high throughput, with an aggregated **36.2 RPS**.

### ⚠️ Failure Rates & Error Types
- `/current_weather` experienced **87 failures**, including 2 `HTTP 0` errors.
- `/weather_by_coords` had **114 failures**, with 8 instances of "Remote end closed connection without response".
- `/weather_forecast` was the most stable, with only **2 failures**.
- No failures were recorded per second (`Failure/s = 0`), indicating isolated issues rather than systemic breakdowns.

### 🐢 Latency & Response Time Distribution
- All endpoints shared identical latency profiles:
  - **Median (50%ile):** 90 ms
  - **95%ile:** 140 ms
  - **99%ile & 100%ile:** 21,000 ms
- This suggests consistent mid-range performance but severe tail latency spikes, likely due to backend timeouts or queuing delays.

### 📉 Average Response Time
- The average response time across all endpoints was **5679 ms**, which is significantly higher than the median—indicating the presence of high-latency outliers skewing the mean.

---

### ⚡ Spike Test

<img width="1386" height="687" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90ae1e4a-44a7-46b0-b88a-dd8cf301410a" />

## 📌 Key Observations

### ✅ Request Volume & Endpoint Behavior
- A total of **1,069 requests** were distributed across three endpoints.
- `/current_weather` received the highest traffic (**528 requests**), followed by `/weather_by_coords` (**360**) and `/weather_forecast` (**181**).
- No failures were recorded across any endpoint, indicating stable request handling.

### 🐢 Latency & Response Time Distribution
- All endpoints exhibited **extremely high response times**:
  - Average response time exceeded **16 seconds** for all endpoints.
  - Minimum latency was **4470 ms**, while maximum latency reached **~70 seconds**.
- Percentile breakdowns show consistent mid-range latency (~8800–9400 ms) but severe spikes at the **100%ile**, suggesting backend queuing or timeout issues.

### 📉 Throughput & Efficiency
- Request throughput was low:
  - `/current_weather`: **0.4 RPS**
  - `/weather_by_coords`: **0.3 RPS**
  - `/weather_forecast`: **0.1 RPS**
  - Aggregated: **0.8 RPS**
- These low RPS values may indicate bottlenecks in processing or intentional throttling during test execution.

### ⚠️ Payload Size Anomaly
- The aggregated average size is reported as **5974 bytes**, which is inconsistent with individual endpoint sizes (~507–574 bytes). This may be a reporting error or miscalculation in aggregation logic.

## 8. Analysis of Findings

Overall, the OpenWeatherMap API showed **high resilience** and **low latency** under normal and sustained loads. However, some issues appeared during heavy and spike testing:

| Observation                             | Potential Cause               | Recommendation                       |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Latency spikes beyond 800 users         | API throttling / rate limits  | Use API keys with higher rate limits |
| Short-term timeout errors during spikes | Load balancer limits          | Enable local request caching         |
| Throughput drop under stress            | Network congestion / rate cap | Apply load distribution logic        |

**Conclusion of Analysis:**
The API is reliable for general public or educational use but not optimized for enterprise-scale concurrent access without premium-tier upgrades.

---

## 9. Recommendations

1. **Implement Local Caching:** Reduce duplicate calls for popular locations (e.g., London, Tokyo).
2. **Upgrade API Subscription:** Higher request limits will minimize 429 “Too Many Requests” errors.
3. **Use Load Balancers or Proxies:** Distribute traffic for large-scale integrations.
4. **Employ Continuous Monitoring:** Tools like Grafana, Prometheus, or New Relic can provide live insight.
5. **Optimize Client Request Patterns:** Introduce controlled request intervals to avoid triggering rate limits.

---

## 10. Conclusion

This project demonstrated the full cycle of **performance testing using Locust** on the **OpenWeatherMap API**.
Through systematic testing (Load, Stress, Soak, Spike), the API’s strengths and weaknesses were revealed:

* Stable under normal and long-term loads
* Degraded performance at extreme concurrency
* Quick recovery post-spike
* Clear evidence of rate limiting at high traffic levels

These findings validate the original hypothesis and showcase Locust’s effectiveness for real-world API performance analysis.
