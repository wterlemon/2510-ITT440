# :boom: Stress Testing on Local Flask Web App using Siege
---

## Introduction
This performance testing was performed using Siege which is an open source regression test and benchmarking utility tool that available in Kali Linux to test high level of concurrent on a local flask web app that is simulation of Liquipedia.net pages. The purpose of this testing is to obsereve system behaviour when many user load access in one time and their performance. The test was conducted three test with different amount of virtual user in 60 seconds which were 10 users,50 users and 100 users. The target data to collect was transactions data, the availabilty, average response time in seconds and failed request.

---
## Objective
-  To measure the average response time and the system's performance under various amount of concurrent user traffic using Siege.
-  To determine the maximum handling capacity of the web server functionality and efficiency
-  To show and ensure how stress can be performed safely and ethically by using a local flask web app instead of real website.
