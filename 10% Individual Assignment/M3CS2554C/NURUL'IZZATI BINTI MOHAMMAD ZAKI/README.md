## 🧭 Introduction

This project focuses on evaluating the performance and stability of the **JSONPlaceholder API** by running a **load test** using **Artillery**, a popular open-source performance testing tool built for Node.js.  
The aim is to measure the system’s behavior when multiple users access it simultaneously and to determine how well it performs under different traffic conditions.

---

## 🎯 Goal and Hypothesis

The main goal of this test is to analyze how **JSONPlaceholder** handles increasing user load and whether it remains stable under pressure.

**Hypothesis:**  
> The JSONPlaceholder API will maintain good performance under load, with average response times below 500 milliseconds, minimal latency spikes, and no request failures even at peak user load.

## 📋 Test Scenario Configuration

Each virtual user (VU) simulates a normal usage pattern by sending a sequence of API requests.  

| Step | Action | Endpoint | Method |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Retrieve a post | `/posts/1` | GET |
| 2 | Retrieve a user | `/users/1` | GET |
| 3 | Create a new post | `/posts` | POST |
| 4 | Wait between requests | — | think(1s) |

## 📈 Load Phases

| Phase | Duration | Arrival Rate | Ramp To | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Low | 30s | 2 users/sec | 5 users/sec | Establish baseline load |
| Moderate | 60s | 5 users/sec | 10 users/sec | Typical daily traffic simulation |
| Heavy | 90s | 10 users/sec | 15 users/sec | Peak traffic to test stability |

This gradual increase simulates real-world traffic, helping to identify how performance scales with concurrent users.

## 📊 Data Analysis

### 🔹 Throughput
The request rate increased smoothly from **8–10/sec** in the low phase to around **44/sec** at the heavy phase.  
✅ The API managed the higher request load without errors or timeouts.

---

### 🔹 Response Time

| **Metric** | **Value** |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Minimum** | 3 ms |
| **Mean** | 126.1 ms |
| **Median (p50)** | 67.4 ms |
| **95th Percentile** | 320.6 ms |
| **99th Percentile** | 415.8 ms |
| **Maximum** | 1,070 ms |

⚡ Most responses were completed in under **0.3 seconds**, which is fast and efficient for an open REST API.

---

### 🔹 HTTP Status Codes

| **Status Code** | **Count** | **Description** |
|------------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **200** | 3,360 | Successful `GET` requests |
| **201** | 1,680 | Successful `POST` requests |
| **Errors** | 0 | No failures recorded |

✅ The high number of `2xx` codes confirms consistent uptime and stability during all test phases.

## 📉 Graph Interpretation (Artillery Cloud)

| **Metric** | **Interpretation** |
|-------------|--------------------|
| **Request Rate Graph** | Shows consistent increase across phases, confirming stable ramp-up. |
| **Response Time (p95)** | Slight rise during heavy load, but remains within acceptable range. |
| **Virtual Users Graph** | Demonstrates smooth user scaling and proper concurrency simulation. |

---

## 🧠 Result Interpretation and Discussion

The system remained **responsive and reliable** through all test stages.  
No requests failed, and latency stayed below **500 ms** for nearly all interactions.  
Occasional response spikes (around **1 second**) appeared only in the 99th percentile — normal during high concurrency.

This result demonstrates that **JSONPlaceholder’s API infrastructure** is resilient and capable of handling steady traffic.

---

### ⚠️ Identified Bottlenecks

| **Observation** | **Impact** |
|------------------|------------|
| Minor latency spikes during heavy load | Negligible; short-lived and within expected tolerance |
| Lack of backend metrics | Could not monitor CPU/memory since the API is public |
| Network delay variance | Slight changes due to routing and external latency factors |

## 🧭 Recommendations and Test Plan Justification

### 💡 Recommendations for Real Scenarios

- Add **caching and CDN layers** to optimize repeated request delivery.  
- Integrate **Prometheus** or **Grafana** for system-level monitoring (CPU, RAM).  
- Conduct **stress** and **soak tests** to identify maximum capacity and memory leaks.  
- Run tests from **multiple regions** to study global latency performance.

### 📘 Test Plan and Tool Justification

| **Aspect** | **Justification** |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **Test Design** | Gradual ramp-up mimics real-world behavior, avoiding traffic spikes. |
| **Tool Selection** | Artillery chosen for clarity, YAML-based config, and detailed percentile tracking. |
| **Industry Practice** | Follows ISO/IEC 25010 and ISTQB testing guidelines for performance evaluation. |
