INTRODUCTION TO WEB APPLICATION PERFORMANCE TESTING & ANALYSIS
A web application performance testing is a form of non-functional testing that measures the behavior, stability, speed and scalability of a web application in a number of work loads and conditions. It tries to find out the performance bottlenecks and make sure that the application can sustain the anticipated user loads and has a good user experience.
