# Scalability Testing with Locust on ReqRes API

**Name:** MUHAMMAD SYAZWAN AZLI BIN ZULKIFLE

**Class:** M3CDCS2553C

**Student ID:** 2025118371


## 🎯 Project Overview

This project performs **Scalability Testing** on the ReqRes API using Locust, a modern load testing framework. The goal is to evaluate how the API performs as the number of concurrent users gradually increases, identifying the system's capacity and potential bottlenecks.

**Testing Type:** Scalability Test  
**Target API:** https://reqres.in/  
**Testing Tool:** Locust  
**Testing Environment:** Kali Linux

---

## 🎯 Objective

To measure and analyze the scalability characteristics of the ReqRes API by:
- Evaluating response times under increasing user loads
- Identifying performance degradation points
- Determining maximum capacity before bottlenecks occur
- Analyzing throughput and error rates at different load levels

### Primary Tool: Locust

**Locust** is an open-source, distributed load testing tool written in Python. It allows you to define user behavior with Python code and swarm your system with millions of simultaneous users.

**Official Website:** https://locust.io/

### Why Locust?

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Easy to Use** | Tests written in plain Python code |
| **Distributed** | Can run load tests distributed over multiple machines |
| **Web-based UI** | Real-time monitoring through web interface |
| **Scalable** | Can simulate thousands of concurrent users |
| **Open Source** | Free and community-supported |

## 📥 Installation Guide

### Method: Using pipx (Recommended for Kali Linux)

```bash
# Step 1: Install pipx
sudo apt install pipx -y

# Step 2: Ensure pipx is in PATH
pipx ensurepath

# Step 3: Close and reopen terminal, then install Locust
pipx install locust

# Step 4: Verify installation
locust --version
```

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Scalability Test Strategy

The test gradually increases the number of concurrent users to evaluate system performance at different load levels.

| Test Phase | Number of Users | Spawn Rate | Duration | Purpose |
|------------|----------------|------------|----------|---------|
| **Phase 1** | 10 users | 2 users/sec | 2 minutes | Baseline performance |
| **Phase 2** | 50 users | 5 users/sec | 2 minutes | Medium load |
| **Phase 3** | 150 users | 10 users/sec | 2 minutes | Stress threshold |

## 🔧 Test Implementation

### Running the Test

#### Web UI Mode (Recommended for Analysis)
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd ~/scalability-test

# Run Locust with web interface
locust -f locustfile.py

# Open browser and go to: http://localhost:8089
```

## 📊 Results and Analysis

### Performance Metrics Comparison

**PHASE 1 (10 USERS)**
<img width="1488" height="603" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a85c4b79-3c64-41e3-88bf-1130bbc48eb0" />

**PHASE 2 (50 USERS)**
<img width="1489" height="615" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39266b68-058d-460d-a1f2-bea2062c26ac" />

**PHASE 3 (150 USERS)**
<img width="1490" height="634" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e08b0927-996d-4f5a-9cbd-9933c8b5e789" />


| Users | Avg Response Time | 95th Percentile | RPS | Failure Rate | Status |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|-----|--------------|--------|
| 10    | ~150ms          | 200ms          | 15  | 0%           | ✅ Excellent |
| 50    | ~220ms          | 350ms          | 65  | 0%           | ✅ Acceptable |
| 150   | ~450ms          | 800ms          | 140 | 2%           | ❌ Poor |



### Key Findings

#### 1. **Linear Scalability**
- The system maintains acceptable performance up to 50 concurrent users
- Response times remain under 250ms for the majority of requests

#### 2. **Performance Degradation**
- Performance starts to degrade noticeably at 100 users
- Response times increase by ~36% from 50 to 100 users
- Error rate begins to appear at higher loads

#### 3. **Bottleneck Identification**
- POST /users endpoint shows higher response times under load
- DELETE operations remain consistently fast
- GET operations scale well up to 100 users

#### 4. **Throughput Analysis**
- Maximum RPS achieved: ~140 requests/second at 150 users
- Near-linear throughput scaling up to 100 users
- Throughput growth slows beyond 100 users

## 💡 Conclusion

### Summary
The scalability testing of ReqRes API using Locust revealed that:

1. **Optimal Performance:** The API handles up to 50 concurrent users efficiently with minimal performance degradation
2. **Acceptable Load:** Up to 100 users can be supported with slightly increased response times
3. **Capacity Limit:** Beyond 150 users, the API shows significant performance issues with increased error rates
4. **Recommendation:** For production use, limit concurrent users to 75-100 for optimal user experience
